description: How to launch prime-rl training runs — the `rl`, `sft`, and `inference` entrypoints, their config classes, and single-node/SLURM/dry-run modes. Use when starting a run or picking the right entrypoint.
---

# Start a run

All entrypoints run via `uv run <command>` and accept TOML configs via `@ path/to.toml` plus CLI overrides.

## Config system at a glance

[`pydantic-config`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/pydantic-config) — Pydantic-based TOML + CLI loader. Highlights (see the `configs` skill for full mechanics):

- Config files via `@ path` (TOML / YAML / JSON); CLI args layer on top, deep-merged with class defaults.
- Nested groups via dotted CLI paths — kebab-case on the CLI, snake_case in TOML.
- Bool toggles: bare `--flag` enables, `--no-flag` disables (nested too).
- Lists: space-separated or JSON literal. Dicts: JSON literal, deep-merged with file values.
- Optional sub-configs (`WandbConfig | None`): bare `--wandb` enables defaults; `--wandb @ wandb.toml` enables from a file; `--no-wandb` disables.
- Discriminated unions are switched by the `type` tag (e.g. `--optimizer.type muon`).
- Validation aliases let renamed fields keep working; legacy keys can be remapped in a `model_validator(mode="before")`.
- Auto-generated `--help` panels from `Field(description=...)` or PEP 224 docstrings.
- Friendly errors: required-field boxes, validator errors point at the offending flag, unknown flags get a "did you mean" hint.

## `rl` — RL training

Launches inference server, orchestrator, and trainer as subprocesses.

```bash
uv run rl @ examples/reverse_text/rl.toml
uv run rl @ examples/reverse_text/rl.toml @ examples/reverse_text/slurm_rl.toml   # SLURM
uv run rl @ examples/reverse_text/rl.toml --dry-run                                # write scripts, don't run
```

- Config: `RLConfig` (`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/rl.py`)
- Entrypoint: `src/prime_rl/entrypoints/rl.py`
- SLURM: single- and multi-node
- Environment packages: before launching a config with a non-core verifier env id,
  verify the package imports under `uv run` (for example
  `uv run python -c "import importlib.util; print(importlib.util.find_spec('r2e_gym_v1'))"`).
  If a local env exists under `deps/research-environments/environments/` but does not
  import, add it to the root `pyproject.toml` env extra, workspace members, and
  `[tool.uv.sources]`, then run `uv sync --all-extras`.

### Optional async value plane

An RL config with `[value_function]` always adds a `value-trainer`, which pulls
finalized rollouts from a bounded, nonblocking producer FIFO into a
rollout-granular replay buffer. Dedicated evaluation is the default and adds a
`value-evaluator` serving copy. Setting
`value_function.evaluator.placement = "trainer"` instead queues evaluation on
the live value trainer between updates. Do not add value loss or value-model
state to the policy trainer.

- Local runs reserve `deployment.num_value_train_gpus` after the policy GPUs.
  Dedicated placement also reserves `num_value_eval_gpus`; trainer placement
  requires it to resolve to zero.
- Multi-node runs similarly reserve value-trainer nodes and reserve evaluator
  nodes only in dedicated placement. Start from
  `examples/value_function/rl.toml` and set the multi-node deployment and
  scheduler fields for the target environment.
- Privileged value context defaults to an optional static native-v1 task
  `value_function_prompt`. Set `value_function.privileged_context =
  "group_leave_one_out"` to use each complete GRPO group member's K-1 peer
  trajectories and rewards instead. Conditioned branches are never truncated
  and must fit `value_function.model.seq_len`.
- GRPO value-backed baseline choices are `value` and `tether`. TETHER is
  adaptive by default, uses a leave-one-out anchor, inherits its regression
  window from `value_function.batch_size`, initializes `rho` at zero, and uses
  EMA decay `0.95`. It subtracts `B + rho * (V-B)` from the fixed critic policy
  lambda-return, starting at `Q_lambda - B_LOO` (also exact LOO when policy
  lambda is one). Set `baseline.adaptive = "None"` to use the static `rho = 0.5`
  coefficient. To opt into branch-local fixed action buckets, configure
  `baseline.adaptive.position.bin_size`; sparse buckets hold their previous
  coefficient, and the global one-coefficient mode remains the default.
- Branched envs need no declaration at the all-ones return defaults. If their
  branches are sequential episode segments and discounted or lambda-based
  credit must cross them, set the per-env algorithm's
  `branch_semantics = "sequential"`; do not use it for parallel forks.
- Launch trainer placement through `rl`, not the standalone `value-trainer`
  command; the managed run-done file owns serve-only shutdown.
- Check `logs/value_trainer.log`, evaluator `/health` and `/version`, plus
  `logs/value_evaluator.log` in dedicated placement and
  producer-queue and `value/replay_*` metrics. `value_function.batch_size`
  inherits the policy rollout batch size unless set explicitly; token-batched
  policy runs must set it explicitly. The producer retains 2048 pending
  rollouts by default and drops the oldest on overload; value work must not
  backpressure policy rollout generation.
- Value checkpoints live under `<output_dir>/value` and have an independent
  version. `warmup_updates` gates only policy-batch shipping while generation
  and value training continue. The gate uses the minimum evaluator version in
  the exact post-filter cohort, so stale cohorts remain blocked after the live
  evaluator advances. Batches with no value-scored samples use the live
  evaluator version, preserving an explicitly configured global barrier.
  Replay uses the same rules during and after warmup.
  `replay.max_updates_per_rollout` is a hard per-rollout selection cap;
  its default capacity and refill threshold are both
  `max_updates_per_rollout * value_function.batch_size`. Replay state is not
  checkpointed and refills from fresh rollouts after resume.
## `sft` — SFT training

Launches torchrun internally — never call torchrun directly.

```bash
uv run sft @ examples/reverse_text/sft.toml
uv run sft @ examples/reverse_text/sft.toml --slurm
uv run sft @ examples/reverse_text/sft.toml --dry-run
```

- Config: `SFTConfig` (`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/sft.py`)
- Entrypoint: `src/prime_rl/entrypoints/sft.py`
- SLURM: single- and multi-node

## `inference` — vLLM server

OpenAI-compatible API plus prime-rl custom endpoints (`/update_weights`, `/load_lora_adapter`, `/init_broadcaster`). Always use this entrypoint — never `vllm serve` directly.

```bash
uv run inference @ configs/debug/infer.toml
uv run inference --model.name Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --model.enforce-eager
```

Smoke checks:

```bash
curl http://<host>:<port>/health
curl http://<host>:<port>/v1/models
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}], "max_tokens": 50}'
```

- Config: `InferenceConfig` (`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/inference.py`)
- Entrypoint: `src/prime_rl/entrypoints/inference.py`
- SLURM: single-node, multi-node, and disaggregated deployments

## Cross-cluster launches with cluv

Use the repository's pinned launcher, not a bare `cluv` command. It initializes
the remote git submodules and runs `uv sync --all-extras`, which upstream
cluv's default sync does not do:

```bash
uv run scripts/cluv_prime_rl.py submit mila \
  --gpus-per-node=2 --time=4:00:00 \
  -- rl @ examples/reverse_text/rl.toml
```

For a single-node run, do not include a config with `[slurm]`; cluv already
owns that Slurm submission. For multi-node runs, synchronize and invoke
prime-rl's launcher on the remote login node:

```bash
uv run scripts/cluv_prime_rl.py run mila -- \
  --no-sync rl @ examples/multinode/rl.toml \
  --output-dir cluv-results/my-run
```

See `docs/cluv.md` for cluster overrides, result fetching, and the `first`
cluster workflow. Before adding a cluster, use `cluv_prime_rl.py sh sacctmgr`
and `cluv_prime_rl.py sh sinfo` as documented there; do not guess its account,
partition, or GPU request syntax.

Remote sync uses the project-specific `$SCRATCH/.cache/prime-values-uv` cache,
not the shared home uv cache. If an interrupted cache entry fails installation
with a missing wheel `METADATA` or `RECORD` file, clean only the named package
from that cache and retry. Do not remove the whole cache or `.venv`.

## Summary
